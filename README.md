### Your Ultimate Decentralized Notes App

Welcome to Notes256, the innovative notes app designed for flexibility, security, and convenience. With Notes256, you can seamlessly create and manage your notes across three distinct storage environments:

#### Local Notes
Local Notes are perfect for quick notes and draft-like content. These notes are saved directly to your device, ensuring fast and easy access without needing an internet connection. Ideal for jotting down fleeting thoughts or temporary information that you can access offline.

#### Web Notes
Web Notes are designed for users who want to sync their notes across multiple devices. By storing your notes in a secure Web2 environment with user authentication, you can access your notes from anywhere, ensuring that your important information is always within reach.

#### Block Notes
Block Notes offer a unique way to create and store notes that represent proofs or certifications. When you publish a note to the blockchain, it becomes immutable and permanently stored, and you receive an NFT that acts as a certificate of authenticity and ownership. This is perfect for safeguarding original ideas, important statements, or any content that you want to ensure remains tamper-proof and securely owned by you, without relying on centralized entities.
