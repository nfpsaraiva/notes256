## Welcome to Provify!

Here, you can secure your original ideas and important statements on the blockchain, ensuring they are permanently recorded and verifiable by anyone.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Write Your Idea or Statement:**

On the main page, you'll find a form where you can write your idea, statement, or any content you wish to secure.
Enter a title and a detailed description or content of your idea.

**Submit Your Idea:**

Once you’ve entered your idea or statement, click the "Submit" button.
Our system will ask you to connect a web3 wallet. If you don't have one, we'll guide you through setting up a wallet (like MetaMask) – it's like an online account for interacting with blockchain applications.

**Secure on the Blockchain:**

When you submit, your idea is securely recorded on the blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger. This ensures that the idea is time-stamped and owned by you.
Additionally, an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is created and sent to your wallet. This NFT serves as proof of ownership and authenticity.

**Receive Proof of Submission:**

After submission, you'll receive a unique proof (in the form of an NFT) in your wallet. This digital certificate contains all the details of your idea and verifies that you were the first to record it.

**Verify and Share:**

Anyone can verify the authenticity of your idea by searching on our platform using the provided unique ID or NFT details.
Share your idea and its proof of authenticity with others, knowing it's securely recorded and verifiable by anyone.

**Key Features:**
Ownership: Your submitted ideas are tied to your wallet, proving that you are the original author.
Immutability: Once recorded on the blockchain, your ideas cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring a permanent and tamper-proof record.
Transparency: Anyone can verify the authenticity and timestamp of your idea without needing special permissions.
